âœ… Confirmed:
- Starting with a clear definition of the usecase and requirements establishes the criteria against which you can evaluate all models, esnuring alignment with business objectives.
- Regular testing and updates help maintain alignment with performance goals and changing business needs.
- Comparing a model's performance, speed, reliability, and costs, ensures the model fits the specific business and technical requirements
- Fine-tuning lets the model internalise domain-specific behaviour and respond more accurately in context.
